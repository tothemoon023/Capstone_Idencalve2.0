| Connection timeout | Refresh page, try again |
| CORS errors | Restart development server |
| Browser blocking | Allow popups for localhost |

### **Step 5: Demo Script Adaptation**

**If wallet connection fails, adapt the script:**

**"Let me demonstrate the user interface and explain how the wallet integration works:"**

1. **"This is the user's control center"** - Show dashboard
2. **"Users can manage their profile"** - Show profile page
3. **"Document upload is secure"** - Show upload interface
4. **"Verification requests are handled here"** - Show verification page
5. **"Privacy controls are central"** - Show consent management
6. **"Selective disclosure gives granular control"** - Show data sharing

**"The wallet connection works through Solana's wallet adapter, which provides:**
- **Secure authentication** without passwords
- **User control** over their private keys
- **Blockchain integration** for identity verification
- **Privacy protection** through decentralized storage

**The connection issue you're seeing is likely a development environment configuration that we can resolve for production."**
